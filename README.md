# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)  
This year, I'm learning [Go](https://go.dev)

## Use

Each day's challenge is inside its own folder.  
The input for the challenge is in that same folder in a file called input.txt.

Run `go run dayN/main.go` from the root folder to run the Nth challenge.  
It is necessary to run it from the root directory as I hardcoded the path to the input file.
